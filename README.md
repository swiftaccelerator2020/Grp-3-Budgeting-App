Wishey is a budgeting app that allows young adults to keep track of their monthly budget, income, expenses and savings. It provides insights on their spendings and allows the user to make responsible and reasonable choices, through pie charts, bar graphs and listing. It also has a wishlist, for users to keep track of gifts and items in which they would like to purchase. Other than the aforementioned features, Wishey also allows users to plan their expenses for spending categories with their income and projected savings in mind. We wanted to develop an app to enable users to create an income-based budget by saving more. We hope this app will be able to help users become more financially prepared and aware.

This app was created by Granwyn Tan, Tan Xi Peng Adam, Brydon Ti and Joe Wong under the [2020 Swift Accelerator Programme](https://www.swiftinsg.org/).
