# Wishey
Wishey is a budgeting app that allows young adults to keep track of their monthly budget, income, expenses and savings. It provides insights on their spendings and allows the user to make responsible and reasonable choices, through pie charts, bar graphs and listing. It also has a wish list, for users to keep track of gifts and items in which they would like to purchase. Other than the aforementioned features, Wishey also allows users to plan their expenses for spending categories with their income and projected savings in mind.

This app was created by Granwyn Tan, Tan Xi Peng Adam, Brydon Ti and Joe Wong under the 2020 Swift Accelerator Programme. The Covid-19 Pandemic brought many people a myriad of financial difficulties due to poor money management of savings and spendings. Thus we were inspired to develop an app to enable users to create an income-based budget, to plan and tide over tough times, by saving more. We hope this app will be able to help users become more financially prepared and aware.
